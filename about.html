        <h3>PLAY:</h3>
</div>

        <p>Each player in turn throws the die and continues to throw the die until either a 1 is thrown or they decide
            to stop. If a 1 is thrown they score nothing for that turn. If they elect to stop before a 1 is thrown they
            score the total of the numbers thrown in that turn. The scores are noted for each turn and the player who
            obtains a total score over 100, wins the game, provided they are not then out-scored by a subsequent player
            who has thrown one fewer rolls and still has a turn left.</p><br>
<div class="v">
        <h3>VARIATIONS:</h3>
        </div>

        <p>You can play Pig with two dice. A 1 thrown with either die means a player scores nothing and ends their turn.
            A double-1 ends a player's turn but scores 25 points regardless of what they may have accumulated with the
            previous throws of that turn. Any other double, doubles the score for that throw. For example - double 6,
            totalling 12, scores 24 points.</p>
